# Recrux
A functional, action centered, typescript flavored, and slightly opinionated toolbelt for redux.
Core values:

- Compose reducers and actions in a similar way to plain function composition.
- Never trap developers, always allow for plain redux.
- Create actions using a name, namespace and a reducer for that action
- Promote the re-use of reducer logic without complex abstractions


## Examples
### Reducer composition

`reducer.js`
```javascript
import { composeReducer, fromMap } from 'recrux'

const actions {

}


```
